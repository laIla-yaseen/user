        <h1>LINEAR EQUATIONS</h1>
        <P>An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. the graph of it is a straight line. </P>
        <p>For example.</p>
        <p>y= 8x - 2</p>
        <p>ax<sub>1</sub>+ bx<sub>2</sub> - cx<sub>3</sub>=9</p>
        <p>are some of the examples of a linear equaion  in two and three variables.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Slope of intersection of two linear Equations Linear Equations</p>
        <p>y<sub>1</sub> = mx<sub>1</sub>+ a and </p>
        <p>y<sub>2</sub> = mx<sub>2</sub>+ a  </p>
        <p>for the points p(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and Q(<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is:</p>
      <p>  m = (y<sub>2</sub>-y<sub>1</sub>) / (x<sub>2</sub>- x<sub>1</sub>)</p>
